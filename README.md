# RSNA-Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection

**Primary Objective:**-Identify acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes

Bleeding, also called hemorrhage, is the name used to describe blood loss. It can refer to blood loss inside the body, called internal bleeding, or to blood loss outside of the body, called external bleeding.

Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For example, intracranial hemorrhages account for approximately 10% of strokes in the U.S., where stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death. Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient.

Diagnosis requires an urgent procedure. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such as severe headache or loss of consciousness, highly trained specialists review medical images of the patient’s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. The process is complicated and often time consuming.

In this competition, your challenge is to build an algorithm to detect acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes.

You’ll develop your solution using a rich image dataset provided by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA®) in collaboration with members of the American Society of Neuroradiology and MD.ai.

If successful, you’ll help the medical community identify the presence, location and type of hemorrhage in order to quickly and effectively treat affected patients.

Challenge participants may be invited to present their AI models and methodologies during an award ceremony at the RSNA Annual Meeting which will be held in Chicago, Illinois, USA, from December 1-6, 2019.


**Hemorrhage Types**

Hemorrhage in the head (intracranial hemorrhage) is a relatively common condition that has many causes ranging from trauma, stroke, aneurysm, vascular malformations, high blood pressure, illicit drugs and blood clotting disorders. The neurologic consequences also vary extensively depending upon the size, type of hemorrhage and location ranging from headache to death. The role of the Radiologist is to detect the hemorrhage, characterize the hemorrhage subtype, its size and to determine if the hemorrhage might be jeopardizing critical areas of the brain that might require immediate surgery.

While all acute (i.e. new) hemorrhages appear dense (i.e. white) on computed tomography (CT), the primary imaging features that help Radiologists determine the subtype of hemorrhage are the location, shape and proximity to other structures (see table).

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is blood that is located completely within the brain itself; intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage is blood that has leaked into the spaces of the brain that normally contain cerebrospinal fluid (the ventricles or subarachnoid cisterns). Extra-axial hemorrhages are blood that collects in the tissue coverings that surround the brain (e.g. subdural or epidural subtypes). ee figure.) Patients may exhibit more than one type of cerebral hemorrhage, which c may appear on the same image. While small hemorrhages are less morbid than large hemorrhages typically, even a small hemorrhage can lead to death because it is an indicator of another type of serious abnormality (e.g. cerebral aneurysm). 

What is an intracranial hemorrhage

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) refers to acute bleeding inside your skull or brain. It’s a life-threatening emergency. You should go to the emergency room right away or call 911 if you think you or someone you know is experiencing ICH.
What are the types of ICH?

There are four types of ICH:

    Epidural Hematoma
    Subdural Hematoma
    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
    Intracerebral Hemorrhage

### Epidural Hematoma

A hematoma is a collection of blood, in a clot or ball, outside of a blood vessel. An epidural hematoma occurs when blood accumulates between your skull and the outermost covering of your brain.

It typically follows a head injury, and usually with a skull fracture. High-pressure bleeding is a prominent feature. If you have an epidural hematoma, you may briefly lose consciousness and then regain consciousness.

### Subdural Hematoma:

A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood on the surface of your brain.

It’s typically the result of your head moving rapidly forward and stopping, such as in a car accident. However, it could also suggest abuse in children. This is the same type of movement a child experiences when being shaken.

A subdural hematoma is more common than other ICHs in older people and people with history of heavy alcohol use.

### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:

A subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm. As blood fills the space between the brain and skull, a blood clot forms, causing increased pressure on the brain.

### Intracerebral Hemorrhage:

Intracerebral hemorrhage is when there’s bleeding inside of your brain. This is the most common type of ICH that occurs with a stroke. It’s not usually the result of injury.

A prominent warning sign is the sudden onset of neurological deficit. This is a problem with your brain’s functioning. The symptoms progress over minutes to hours. They include:

    headache
    difficulty speaking
    nausea
    vomiting
    decreased consciousness
    weakness in one part of the body
    elevated blood pressure
